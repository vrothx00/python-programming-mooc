# Some say paying taxes makes Finns happy, so let's see if the secret of happiness lies in one of 
# the taxes set out in Finnish tax code.

# According to the Finnish Tax Administration, a gift is a transfer of property to another 
# person against no compensation or payment. If the total value of the gifts you receive 
# from the same donor in the course of 3 years is â‚¬5,000 or more, you must pay gift tax.

# Write your solution here
