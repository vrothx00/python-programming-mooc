# Please write a program which asks the user for an integer number. 
# If the number is divisible by three, the program should print out Fizz. 
# If the number is divisible by five, the program should print out Buzz. 
# If the number is divisible by both three and five, 
# the program should print out FizzBuzz.

# Write your solution here
